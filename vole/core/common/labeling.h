/** Class for per-pixel label processing.

This class provides methods to import and export pixel masks or labels as
images. Another application is seeding input to supervised segmentation.

The main purpose of this code is to understand and provide "human-readable"
labeling images, where the color of a label can be chosen freely. All distinct
colors observed in the label image lead to a distinct entry in the label set.

The second purpose is to write out labeling images that are human-readable. You
can also let this class create you nice label colors for your own use.

@todo This is also the place for code to "mark" an image, e.g. overlay pixels
with a label color, or in the binary case, highlighting marked pixels. Code for
this already exists in forensics/cmfd.
