Description: This software provides implementation of three algorithms for 2D
and 3D image segmentation. The algorithms implemented are Prim, and Kruskal's
algorithms for Maximum Spanning Forest computation, and the PowerWatershed
algorithm (q=2) described in the above article.

This version of the code was modified by Johannes Jordan in 2010-2012.
